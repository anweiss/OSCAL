## Target Audience

Tool vendors who build security compliance systems (i.e. Electronic Governance Risk and Compliance (eGRC) systems) or who provide secure infrastructure/software solutions to the federal government or highly regulated industries

## Problem OSCAL Solves

Provides a standard for consuming security control, catalogue, profile, and implementation data to visualize and automate security compliance processes.  Provides an assessment standard for infrastructure and software solutions to attest to their security control implementation in an automated manner.

## Why Should You Care?

- Allows security plans to be created programmatically in a consistent manner using automated tools

- Allows infrastructure/software providers to attest to the state of their security control implementation programmatically; reducing the paperwork burden associated with serving federal agencies

- Enables advanced data integration and automation possibilities by exposing security control and assessment data in a standard specification which can be represented via JSON or XML

- Allows vendors to improve the User Experience (UX) and Machine Experience (MX) by offering new tools for security compliance based on leveraging the OSCAL data standard

- Reduces the burden of achieving federal Compliance and Accreditation (C&A) approvals by providing standard controls and assessment results that can be visualized in real-time; speeding market adoption within the federal sector and highly regulated industries

- Minimizes the need for vendors to tailor solutions for specific customers by adhering to a broad-based standard
