## What is OSCAL?

NIST is developing the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) standard and data-centric framework that can be applied to an information system to document and assess its security controls. Today, security controls and profiles are represented in proprietary ways and are expressed in prose format rather than being machine readable. The current environment leads to imprecise implementation, differences in interpretation, and requires manual effort to implement the controls. An important goal of OSCAL is to move the security controls and profiles from a text-based and manual approach (in Word/Excel/etc.) to a standardized and machine-readable format that improves both the User Experience (UX) and Machine Experience (MX) of system security planning, assessment and authorization. With standard, authoritative reference data sets encoded in OSCAL, along with the support of automated processes, security professionals will be able to do better work with less effort.

## Why OSCAL?

Multiple regulatory compliance standards and frameworks (NIST FISMA, PCI, HIPAA, ISO 27001, etc.) that change over time, the requirement to map controls for each, and the volume of information systems to C&A contribute to the complexity of the current environment. The implementation of security systems needs to be validated against the security controls to provide assurance of the system's current compliance posture which is both resource intensive and often infeasible within budget constraints given the complexity of the environment.

The ability of OSCAL to streamline and standardize the security documentation, implementation, and assessment process will reduce complexity, decrease costs to implement, and provide the ability to assess system security continuously against multiple sets of requirements simultaneously. This approach has the added benefit of significantly reducing the paperwork associated with the current process; helping agencies meet the goals of the [Paperwork Reduction Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperwork_Reduction_Act).

## OSCAL Core Terminology

The terms associated with the project are important to understand. The following three terms are foundational for understanding the scope of the project:

1. A **control** is a safeguard or countermeasure designed to satisfy a set of defined security requirements. Individual controls describe practices, procedures, policies and guidelines pertaining to specific aspects and vulnerabilities of systems. In OSCAL, controls are presented in machine-readable, encoded documents suited for automated processes including publishing, indexing, filtering and search.
 
2. A **catalog** aggregates a set of controls. Published catalogs include security standards and specifications such as NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001, COBIT5, and PCI DSSs. Given an encoding in OSCAL, controls from any of these specifications can be made available in machine-readable format.

3. An OSCAL **profile**, also called a *baseline* or (in support of some activities) an *overlay*, describes a specific set of security requirements, in the form of a selection and customization of controls from one or more catalogs. Examples include the high-, moderate- and low-impact-level baselines of NIST SP 800-53, the FedRAMP baselines, and the PCI DSS requirements. Profiles can be tailored versions of other profiles, supporting both inheritance and traceability, to present specialized modifications for any purpose, including the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) requirements of the systems they are designed to support.
