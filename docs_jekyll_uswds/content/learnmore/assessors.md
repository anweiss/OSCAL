**Who: Auditing/assessment personnel who validate the accuracy of security plans and the implementation of security controls within information systems**

OSCAL provides a standard for documenting security controls within a specific profilw while establishing a framework for the information systems to programmatically attest to the state of the security controls.

## Why Should You Care?

- Reduces the amount of manual labor required to provide assurance that controls are implemented as described in the security documentation

- Profiles provide flexibility to tailor baselines to the appropriate controls for any agency information system

- Provides real-time or near real-time assurance programmatically allowing any security drift to be detected earlier; reducing overall risk

- Reduces the number of manual assessments required to gather evidence that security controls are implemented within the target information system

- Provides mapping of catalogs to a common profile, reducing the number of assessments required to ensure compliance with multiple compliance frameworks
