  content: OSCAL seeks to modernize today's paper-based approach to compliance by offering a standards-based data model to allow for automation and streamlining of the current security compliance process.

tagline: A "Standard of Standards" for Automating Security & Compliance
intro: |
  NIST is developing the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) "standard of standards"; a set of hierarchical, formatted, XML- and JSON-based formats that provide a standardized representation for different categories of information pertaining to the publication, implementation, and assessment of security controls. OSCAL is being developed through a collaborative approach with the public. The OSCAL website provides an overview of the OSCAL project including benefits for different stakeholders, comprehensive documentation, and the opportunity to get involved in designing OSCAL.  The OSCAL standard is designed to improve both the User Experience (UX) and the Machine Experience (MX) associated with cyber security and compliance processes.
  
  The OSCAL GitHub repository holds the current OSCAL schemas, examples, documentation source files, and other resources. The NIST team welcomes public contributions to this project. If you are interested in contributing, please [contact us](/getinvolved/) on how to get started.
