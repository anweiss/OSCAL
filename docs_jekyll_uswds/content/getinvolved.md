## Welcome to the OSCAL Community

We are excited that you want to learn more about the OSCAL project! The OSCAL community is a collaborative environment of professionals that contribute to the project's goals and objectives. The community is developing a “standard of standards” that normalizes the representation of system security controls and corresponding information. The focus is to improve security assessment efficiency, accuracy, and consistency. The language must be well-defined and easy to use for both human and machine-readable formats; improving both the User Experience (UX) and the Machine Experience (MX).
