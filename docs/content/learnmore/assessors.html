<p><strong><em>Audit and assessment personnel who validate the accuracy of security plans and assess the implementation of security controls within information systems.</em></strong></p>
  <p>OSCAL standardizes documentation of security controls within a specific profile, while establishing a framework for information systems to attest programmatically to the state of the security controls being addressed.</p>
  <h3>How Does OSCAL Help Me?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Reduces the amount of manual labor need to assess the implementation of controls.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Permits flexibility through profiling for tailoring baselines to a set of appropriate controls for any agency information system.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Provides real-time or near real-time assurance programmatically, allowing any security drift to be detected earlier and reducing overall risk.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Enables mapping standard catalogs of controls to common profiles, reducing the number of assessments required to ensure compliance with multiple frameworks.</p></li>
</ul>
