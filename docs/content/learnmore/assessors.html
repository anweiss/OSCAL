  <p>OSCAL standardizes the format for documentation of security controls, while establishing a framework for the automated assessment of information systems to be evaluated based the state of the security controls being addressed.</p>

  <li>
  <p>Reduces the amount of manual labor need to assess the implementation of controls.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Provides ongoing, automated assessment of an information systems assurance, allowing any drift in control implementation to be detected as it occurs, reducing overall risk.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Enables mapping standard catalogs of controls and common baselines, to system implmentations, reducing the number of assessments required to ensure compliance with multiple frameworks.</p></li>
