## Background

### What is OSCAL?

NIST is developing the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) standard and data-centric framework that can be applied to an information system for documenting and assessing its security controls. Today, security controls and profiles are represented in proprietary ways and are expressed in prose format rather than being machine readable. This can lead to imprecise implementation and differences in interpretation, and requires manual effort to implement the controls. An important goal of OSCAL is to move the security controls and profiles from a text-based and manual approach (using word processors or spreadsheets) to a standardized and machine-readable format that improves both the User Experience (UX) and Machine Experience (MX) of system security planning, assessment and authorization. With standard, authoritative reference data sets encoded in OSCAL, along with the support of automated processes, security professionals will be able to do better work with less effort.

### Why OSCAL?

There are a number of factors contributing to the challenge faced by information system security professionals today: multiple regulatory compliance standards and frameworks ([NIST FISMA](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/federal-information-security-management-act-fisma-implementation-project), [PCI](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/), [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html), [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html) etc.), which change over time; their overlapping scope and the requirement to manage them together; and the size, complexity and ongoing development of the systems being documented. To provide assurance of a system's compliance posture, the implementation of security systems must be both correctly described, and validated against relevant security controls. This is resource-intensive and often infeasible within budget constraints given the complexity of the problem.

The ability of OSCAL to streamline and standardize the security documentation, implementation, and assessment process will reduce complexity, decrease implementation costs, and enable the continuous assessment of system security against multiple sets of requirements simultaneously. This approach has the added benefit of significantly reducing the paperwork associated with current processes, helping government agencies meet the goals of the [Paperwork Reduction Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperwork_Reduction_Act).

## How OSCAL Supports Your Role

Whether you are a policy author, security systems planner, assessor, or a developer of tools to support others, you stand to benefit directly or indirectly from OSCAL. See the [Community](/community/) page for more.

Or go directly to [OSCAL documentation](/docs/).
