**Who: Security professionals who document or implement security controls within information systems**

OSCAL provides a standard for documenting security controls that maps across multiple compliance frameworks (i.e. NIST, PCI, etc.) and a method for attesting to the implementation of the controls within information systems

## Why Should You Care?

- Reduces the need to document controls within Word/Excel which quickly grows stale over time

- Allows for centralization and better configuration management of security documentation which reduces the attack surface and allows for better implementation of least privilege controls

- Reduces the amount of paperwork required to implement multiple compliance frameworks

- Ensures that security as imagined (defined in the controls) matches with security as implemented (through the assessment framework of OSCAL) with minimal need to perform manual assessments

- Reduces the burden associated with cyber security staff attrition as the OSCAL standard ensures consistency in implementation across agencies; reducing the learning curve for new staff

- Provides mapping of catalogs to a common profile, reducing the number of assessments required to ensure compliance with multiple compliance frameworks
