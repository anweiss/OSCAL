## Managing Multiple Regulatory Frameworks

The work being performed by the OSCAL development team to document catalogs that then map to multiple regulatory frameworks will simplify the compliance burden to maintain multiple security plans or to maintain the mapping themselves within a single security plan. 

As an example, a federal agency may need to comply with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and NIST Risk Management Framework requirements. The agency also maintains health records and must comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements. The agency provides healthcare services where payments are collected and payments may be made by patients using a credit card. Credit card transactions must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). The security controls and requirements associated with four separate frameworks increase the complexity and the costs for the agency to maintain the security documentation of systems operating within its portfolio.

The scenario for the sample federal agency highlights the need to simplify the complexity for agencies required to meet multiple regulatory frameworks.  The OSCAL development community took this scenario into consideration when building the foundations for the OSCAL project. The foundational elements of the control, catalog, and profile formats permit selection from multiple catalogs of security controls and the creation of a single profile that an agency may use to maintain compliance. This feature of OSCAL abstracts away the complexity of managing multiple frameworks and reduces the compliance burden while also allowing cyber security professionals to focus on maintaining the security of the system.

The project will continue to expand to support additional security catalogs to maximize the utility of the framework.

## Machine-readable System Security Plans (SSPs)

Cyber security professionals are required to document a system's compliance with regulatory frameworks as part of the Certification and Accreditation (C&A process).  This effort is resource intensive; especially in scenarios where multiple regulatory frameworks govern the system.  In addition, the documentation is not standardized, varies widely between agencies, and is stored in a collection of Word documents, Excel files, and other formats that are difficult to configuration manage.

OSCAL is designed to provide a standardized format to take this paper-based process and convert it to a highly normalized and machine readable format.  This approach has multiple benefits: 1) data between plans is consistent in both format and mapping to compliance frameworks, 2) data is machine readable and can be exposed to other security tools to provide additional automation, 3) having a consistent data standard will allow for innovation in the commercial tooling to provide further automation to the process.

The OSCAL team continues to enhance the OSCAL formats and to test these formats against real data.  The OSCAL formats are being continuously improved and enhanced as they are tested and issues are identified.  The end result will be a robust set of standardized formats that greatly simplify the way security plans are created, and managed; and how technical security controls are implemented and assessed for a system.
