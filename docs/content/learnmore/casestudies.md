## General Services Administation FedRAMP

[Government Computer News Story - FedRAMP Updates](https://gcn.com/articles/2018/06/14/fedramp-updates.aspx)

FedRAMP officials want to make it easier for agencies to get cloud service providers approved. The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Open Security Controls Assessment Language, which speeds up the security controls assessment process through standardization and automation, will be available for testing by the end of this fiscal year, FedRAMP Director Matt Goodrich said at the June 13 ATARC Federal Cloud and Data Center Summit.

OSCAL automates FedRAMP’s security control assessments and tracks associated risks.

“We think OSCAL will really help agencies transform the way that they are doing their work by making sure that they can use whatever tool that they want to use and automate whatever they can in the process to do their authorizations,” Goodrich said.

Goodrich also provided an update on FedRAMP Tailored, a streamlined approval process for low-impact software-as-a-service offerings. He said 15 SaaS offerings are currently in process for authorizations with three already approved.

“Agencies can partner with vendors for authorizations so vendors don’t need to have a third-party assessor or independent auditor,” Goodrich said. It allows agencies to "bring in new and innovative products from small businesses in a way that is cost affordable," he said.

## Docker - Automating Compliance for Highly Regulated Industries with Docker Enterprise Edition and OSCAL

[Docker Blog](https://blog.docker.com/2018/05/automating-compliance-docker-ee-oscal/)

Highly-regulated industries like financial services, insurance, and government have their own set of complex and challenging regulatory IT requirements that must be constantly maintained. For this reason, the introduction of new technology can sometimes be difficult. Docker Enterprise Edition provides these types of organization with both a secure platform on which containers are the foundation for building compliant applications and a workflow for operational governance at scale.

To address these requirements, Docker has collaborated with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and today, we are excited to announce that Docker is fully embracing the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) standard and committing to its future development. OSCAL is a machine-readable, “standard of standards” that normalizes how system security controls and corresponding assessment information are represented. Its goal is to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and consistency of system security assessments and enable a large decrease in assessment-related labor. OSCAL gives users the ability to assess a system’s security state continuously and against several sets of requirements simultaneously. The OSCAL specification is designed with security and agility in mind. It is both XML- and JSON-based, is technology and infrastructure-agnostic, and is incredibly flexible in its use.
