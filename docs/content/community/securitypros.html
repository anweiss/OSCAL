<p><strong><em>Security professionals who implement and document security controls within information systems.</em></strong></p>
  <p>OSCAL provides a standard for documenting security and privacy controls that maps across multiple compliance frameworks (i.e. NIST, PCI, etc.) and a method for attesting to the implementation of the controls within information systems</p>
  <h3>How Does OSCAL Help Me?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Enables continuous maintenance of control documentation within a framework designed for that purpose.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Permits the centralization of configuration management within and across security documentation and applications; this can reduce the attack surface and make it easier to implement controls for least privilege.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Reduces the amount of paperwork required to implement multiple compliance frameworks.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Ensures that security as proposed and planned (defined in the controls) matches with security as implemented, with less need for manual assessments.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Flattens the learning curve for new staff by enabling them to focus on problems not technology.</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>Enables mapping standard catalogs of controls to common profiles, reducing the number of assessments required to ensure compliance with multiple frameworks.</p></li>
</ul>
