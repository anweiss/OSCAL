Profiles currently available are early work; while we do not believe they have errors, they should be regarded as testing documents until authoritative versions can be published. 

## NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Baselines 

The NIST HIGH, MODERATE and LOW baselines for the SP800-53 rev4 catalog are available [in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/master/content/nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4).

## FedRAMP Baselines

Also find examples representing the FedRAMP baselines (again for the HIGH, MODERATE and LOW impact levels) on [our web site](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/master/content/fedramp.gov).
