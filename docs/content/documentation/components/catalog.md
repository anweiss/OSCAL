[See examples of OSCAL catalogs](/resources/examples/catalogs/)

An OSCAL catalog is a set of OSCAL controls published as a body. The catalog for NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4 defines all NIST SP 800-53 controls. Other catalogs can represent controls of any kind, design or purpose. If your organization has a document or formal specification that would benefit from expression in OSCAL (to be used either separately in its own profile or implementation stack or along with NIST SP800-53 controls), 
[the OSCAL team would like to hear from you](mailto:oscal@nist.gov).
