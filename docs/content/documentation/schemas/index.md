## About the Sample Schemas

### Design Principles for Sample Schemas
The sample schemas have been created with the following design principles in mind:

- Simplicity and ease of use.
- Relevance for typical producers. The basic schemas bring to the foreground the functionality that producers typically use. The entire set of schemas provides a foundation upon which one can expand to illustrate additional functionality.
- Extensibility. The sample schemas are designed for adaptability and extensibility. In ordinary cases, users and designers of application can introduce new constructs and usages to support local requirements. In special cases, new schemas may be constructed to work with schemas already in use.

### Producer Benefits of Sample Schemas

Benefits provided by the sample schemas include the following:

#### Continuity of context.

#### Usability

#### Quality
