    <p>Microsoft's Office Open XML is tractable using tools built to its APIs
        and data model, but it is not designed to be an exchange model. OSCAL enables
        greater data interoperability among disparate systems by capturing the semantics of
        controls, independent of how they may be displayed using various representations
        (such as word processors). We expect that word processors will continue to be used
        in workflows supporting OSCAL.</p>
