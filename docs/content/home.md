tagline: Automating Security Assessment & Continuous Monitoring

intro: |
  NIST is developing the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL): a set of models expressed in standard notations (XML, JSON), offering machine-readable representations of information pertaining to the publication, implementation, and assessment of security and privacy controls. By promoting transparency and interoperability along with rigorous validation of data in context, OSCAL formats provide a foundation for automation and machine assistance of many tasks and activities related to systems security.

  OSCAL is being developed through a collaborative approach with the public. It is designed to improve system security planning, assessment, and monitoring, with a technology that is both user- and developer-friendly.
  
  The [OSCAL GitHub repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL) holds the current OSCAL schemas, examples, documentation source files, and other resources.
  They are free to inspect, experiment with and use. Our [Resources page](/resources/) has links to off-site projects and toolkits relating to OSCAL. The NIST team welcomes public contributions to this project; if you are interested, please [contact us](/getinvolved/) to get started.
