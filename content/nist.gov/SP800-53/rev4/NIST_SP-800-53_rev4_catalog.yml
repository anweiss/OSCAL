        - <p>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for
          the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
          in the AC family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws,
          Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.
          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
          policy and procedures.</p>

        - '<p>Information system account types include, for example, individual, shared,
          group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor,
          temporary, and service. Some of the account management requirements listed
          above can be implemented by organizational information systems. The identification
          of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access
          privileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security
          plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts
          receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g.,
          system owner, mission/business owner, or chief information security officer)
          responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Organizations
          may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by
          type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for
          authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week,
          and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations
          consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system
          upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences,
          customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure
          to consider these factors could affect information system availability.
          Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts intended for short-term use.
          Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation
          procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand
          for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts
          in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation.
          Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization
          processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with
          infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special
          tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable).
          Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling
          or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include,
          for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are
          no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated.
          Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training.</p>'

          class: statement
        - prose:
          - <p>In contrast to conventional access control approaches which employ
            static information system accounts and predefined sets of user privileges,
            dynamic access control approaches (e.g., service-oriented architectures)
            rely on run time access control decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege
            management. While user identities may remain relatively constant over
            time, user privileges may change more frequently based on ongoing mission/business
            requirements and operational needs of organizations. Dynamic privilege
            management can include, for example, the immediate revocation of privileges
            from users, as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their
            sessions to reflect any changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management
            can also refer to mechanisms that change the privileges of users based
            on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. This type
            of privilege management includes, for example, automatic adjustments of
            privileges if users are operating out of their normal work times, or if
            information systems are under duress or in emergency maintenance situations.
            This control enhancement also includes the ancillary effects of privilege
            changes, for example, the potential changes to encryption keys used for
            communications. Dynamic privilege management can support requirements
            for information system resiliency.</p>

          - <p>Mandatory access control as defined in this control enhancement is
            synonymous with nondiscretionary access control, and is not constrained
            only to certain historical uses (e.g., implementations using the Bell-LaPadula
            Model). The above class of mandatory access control policies constrains
            what actions subjects can take with information obtained from data objects
            for which they have already been granted access, thus preventing the subjects
            from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects. This
            class of mandatory access control policies also constrains what actions
            subjects can take with respect to the propagation of access control privileges;
            that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass that privilege to other
            subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects
            to which the information system has control. Otherwise, the access control
            policy can be circumvented. This enforcement typically is provided via
            an implementation that meets the reference monitor concept (see AC-25).
            The policy is bounded by the information system boundary (i.e., once the
            information is passed outside of the control of the system, additional
            means may be required to ensure that the constraints on the information
            remain in effect). The trusted subjects described above are granted privileges
            consistent with the concept of least privilege (see AC-6). Trusted subjects
            are only given the minimum privileges relative to the above policy necessary
            for satisfying organizational mission/business needs. The control is most
            applicable when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order,
            directive, or regulation) that establishes a policy regarding access to
            sensitive/classified information and some users of the information system
            are not authorized access to all sensitive/classified information resident
            in the information system. This control can operate in conjunction with
            AC-3 (4). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed
            by this control is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints
            of AC-3 (4), but policies governed by this control take precedence over
            the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4). For example, while a mandatory
            access control policy imposes a constraint preventing a subject from passing
            information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity label,
            AC-3 (4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject with
            the same sensitivity label as the subject.</p>

          - <p>When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects
            are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information
            for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have
            been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e.,
            the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects
            or objects. This control enhancement can operate in conjunction with AC-3
            (3). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed
            by AC-3 (3) is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints
            of this control enhancement. Thus, while AC-3 (3) imposes constraints
            preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating
            at a different sensitivity level, AC-3 (4) permits the subject to pass
            the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy
            is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is
            passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means
            may be required to ensure that the constraints remain in effect. While
            the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control
            require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required
            for this use of discretionary access control.</p>

          - <p>Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control policy that restricts
            information system access to authorized users. Organizations can create
            specific roles based on job functions and the authorizations (i.e., privileges)
            to perform needed operations on organizational information systems associated
            with the organization-defined roles. When users are assigned to the organizational
            roles, they inherit the authorizations or privileges defined for those
            roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations because
            privileges are not assigned directly to every user (which can be a significant
            number of individuals for mid- to large-size organizations) but are instead
            acquired through role assignments. RBAC can be implemented either as a
            mandatory or discretionary form of access control. For organizations implementing
            RBAC with mandatory access controls, the requirements in AC-3 (3) define
            the scope of the subjects and objects covered by the policy.</p>

          - <p>Information systems can only protect organizational information within
            the confines of established system boundaries. Additional security safeguards
            may be needed to ensure that such information is adequately protected
            once it is passed beyond the established information system boundaries.
            Examples of information leaving the system boundary include transmitting
            information to an external information system or printing the information
            on one of its printers. In cases where the information system is unable
            to make a determination of the adequacy of the protections provided by
            entities outside its boundary, as a mitigating control, organizations
            determine procedurally whether the external information systems are providing
            adequate security. The means used to determine the adequacy of the security
            provided by external information systems include, for example, conducting
            inspections or periodic testing, establishing agreements between the organization
            and its counterpart organizations, or some other process. The means used
            by external entities to protect the information received need not be the
            same as those used by the organization, but the means employed are sufficient
            to provide consistent adjudication of the security policy to protect the
            information. This control enhancement requires information systems to
            employ technical or procedural means to validate the information prior
            to releasing it to external systems. For example, if the information system
            passes information to another system controlled by another organization,
            technical means are employed to validate that the security attributes
            associated with the exported information are appropriate for the receiving
            system. Alternatively, if the information system passes information to
            a printer in organization-controlled space, procedural means can be employed
            to ensure that only appropriately authorized individuals gain access to
            the printer. This control enhancement is most applicable when there is
            some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation)
            that establishes policy regarding access to the information, and that
            policy applies beyond the realm of a particular information system or
            organization.</p>

        - '<p>Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel
          within an information system and between information systems (as opposed
          to who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit regard
          to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include,
          for example, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted
          in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be
          from within the organization, restricting web requests to the Internet that
          are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers
          between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring
          information between information systems representing different security
          domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers
          violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information
          owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points
          between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific
          architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies.
          Enforcement includes, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers
          between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only); (ii) employing
          hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and (iii) implementing
          trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security
          labels. Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies
          and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated
          sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within
          information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is
          based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path.
          Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways,
          routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or
          establish configuration settings that restrict information system services,
          provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering
          capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches
          or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness
          of filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software
          components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements
          3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain solution needs which focus on
          more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow
          enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example,
          high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in
          commercial off-the-shelf information technology products.</p>'

            data contents (e.g., age, location, telephone number). Enforcing allowed

            flow control. Organizations consider the trustworthiness of metadata with
            regard to data accuracy (i.e., knowledge that the metadata values are
            correct with respect to the data), data integrity (i.e., protecting against
            unauthorized changes to metadata tags), and the binding of metadata to
            the data payload (i.e., ensuring sufficiently strong binding techniques

            and content. For example, security policy filters for data structures
            can check for maximum file lengths, maximum field sizes, and data/file
            types (for structured and unstructured data). Security policy filters
            for data content can check for specific words (e.g., dirty/clean word
            filters), enumerated values or data value ranges, and hidden content.
            Structured data permits the interpretation of data content by applications.
            Unstructured data typically refers to digital information without a particular
            data structure or with a data structure that does not facilitate the development
            of rule sets to address the particular sensitivity of the information
            conveyed by the data or the associated flow enforcement decisions. Unstructured
            data consists of: (i) bitmap objects that are inherently non language-based
            (i.e., image, video, or audio files); and (ii) textual objects that are
            based on written or printed languages (e.g., commercial off-the-shelf
            word processing documents, spreadsheets, or emails). Organizations can
            implement more than one security policy filter to meet information flow
            control objectives (e.g., employing clean word lists in conjunction with
            dirty word lists may help to reduce false positives).</p>'

            logon occurs (e.g., personal digital assistants, smart phones, tablets).
            The logon is to the mobile device, not to any one account on the device.
            Therefore, successful logons to any accounts on mobile devices reset the
            unsuccessful logon count to zero. Organizations define information to
            be purged/wiped carefully in order to avoid over purging/wiping which
            may result in devices becoming unusable. Purging/wiping may be unnecessary
            if the information on the device is protected with sufficiently strong
            encryption mechanisms.</p>

          to log out because of the temporary nature of their absences. Session locks
          are implemented where session activities can be determined. This is typically
          at the operating system level, but can also be at the application level.
          Session locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of information
          systems, for example, if organizations require users to log out at the end
          of workdays.</p>

          no identification or authentication is required in organizational information
          systems. Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without
          identification or authentication including, for example, when individuals
          access public websites or other publicly accessible federal information
          systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles
          are received. Organizations also identify actions that normally require
          identification or authentication but may under certain circumstances (e.g.,
          emergencies), allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed.
          Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch
          that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental
          or unmonitored use. This control does not apply to situations where identification
          and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated, but rather
          to situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred.
          Organizations may decide that there are no user actions that can be performed
          on organizational information systems without identification and authentication
          and thus, the values for assignment statements can be none.</p>

      - prose:
        - <p>Information is represented internally within information systems using
          abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent
          different types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also
          known as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or
          processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known
          as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records,
          buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Security
          attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions representing the basic
          properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect
          to safeguarding information. These attributes may be associated with active
          entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive information,
          to cause information to flow among objects, or to change the information
          system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive entities
          (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association of
          security attributes to subjects and objects is referred to as binding and
          is typically inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute
          type. Security attributes when bound to data/information, enables the enforcement
          of information security policies for access control and information flow
          control, either through organizational processes or information system functions
          or mechanisms. The content or assigned values of security attributes can
          directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information.
          Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for selected information
          systems to support missions/business functions. There is potentially a wide
          range of values that can be assigned to any given security attribute. Release
          markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or NOFORN (not releasable
          to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and values,
          organizations can ensure that the security attribute values are meaningful
          and relevant. The term security labeling refers to the association of security
          attributes with subjects and objects represented by internal data structures
          within organizational information systems, to enable information system-based
          enforcement of information security policies. Security labels include, for
          example, access authorizations, data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption
          and data expiration), nationality, affiliation as contractor, and classification
          of information in accordance with legal and compliance requirements. The
          term security marking refers to the association of security attributes with
          objects in a human-readable form, to enable organizational process-based
          enforcement of information security policies. The AC-16 base control represents
          the requirement for user-based attribute association (marking). The enhancements
          to AC-16 represent additional requirements including information system-based
          attribute association (labeling). Types of attributes include, for example,
          classification level for objects and clearance (access authorization) level
          for subjects. An example of a value for both of these attribute types is
          Top Secret.</p>

        - <p>Remote access is access to organizational information systems by users
          (or processes acting on behalf of users) communicating through external
          networks (e.g., the Internet). Remote access methods include, for example,
          dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted virtual
          private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity over remote
          connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote;
          however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate security
          controls (e.g., employing appropriate encryption techniques for confidentiality
          and integrity protection) may provide sufficient assurance to the organization
          that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks.  Still,
          VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not
          enhance the availability of remote connections. Also, VPNs with encrypted
          tunnels can affect the organizational capability to adequately monitor network
          communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply
          to information systems other than public web servers or systems designed
          for public access. This control addresses authorization prior to allowing
          remote access without specifying the formats for such authorization. While
          organizations may use interconnection security agreements to authorize remote
          access connections, such agreements are not required by this control. Enforcing
          access restrictions for remote connections is addressed in AC-3.</p>

        - '<p>A mobile device is a computing device that: (i) has a small form factor
          such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; (ii) is designed
          to operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive
          information); (iii) possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage;
          and (iv) includes a self-contained power source. Mobile devices may also
          include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the
          device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing
          local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, E-readers,
          and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual
          and the device is usually in close proximity to the individual; however,
          the degree of proximity can vary depending upon on the form factor and size
          of the device. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the
          mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of desktop systems,
          depending upon the nature and intended purpose of the device. Due to the
          large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics
          and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different
          classes/types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation
          guidance for mobile devices include, for example, configuration management,
          device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective
          software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for
          malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical
          software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly
          other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware
          (e.g., wireless, infrared). Organizations are cautioned that the need to
          provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements
          in this control. Many safeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices
          are reflected in other security controls in the catalog allocated in the
          initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security
          plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some degree
          of overlap in the requirements articulated by the security controls within
          the different families of controls. AC-20 addresses mobile devices that
          are not organization-controlled.</p>'

          facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations, convention centers, shopping malls,
          or airports); (iii) information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal
          governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information systems that are
          not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority
          of organizations. This control also addresses the use of external information
          systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of organizational information,
          including, for example, accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as
          a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational
          information systems. For some external information systems (i.e., information
          systems operated by other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate
          to those agencies), the trust relationships that have been established between
          those organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no
          explicit terms and conditions are required. Information systems within these
          organizations would not be considered external. These situations occur when,
          for example, there are pre-existing sharing/trust agreements (either implicit
          or explicit) established between federal agencies or organizations subordinate
          to those agencies, or when such trust agreements are specified by applicable
          laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies. Authorized individuals
          include, for example, organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals
          with authorized access to organizational information systems and over which
          organizations have the authority to impose rules of behavior with regard
          to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals
          need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending upon the trust
          relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose
          to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state,
          local, or tribal governments. This control does not apply to the use of
          external information systems to access public interfaces to organizational
          information systems (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through
          www.usa.gov). Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of
          external information systems in accordance with organizational security
          policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum: types
          of applications that can be accessed on organizational information systems
          from external information systems; and the highest security category of
          information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external information
          systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external information
          systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on
          organizational personnel using those external systems.</p>'

          - <p>In distributed information systems, authorization processes and access
            control decisions may occur in separate parts of the systems. In such
            instances, authorization information is transmitted securely so timely
            access control decisions can be enforced at the appropriate locations.
            To support the access control decisions, it may be necessary to transmit
            as part of the access authorization information, supporting security attributes.
            This is due to the fact that in distributed information systems, there
            are various access control decisions that need to be made and different
            entities (e.g., services) make these decisions in a serial fashion, each
            requiring some security attributes to make the decisions. Protecting access
            authorization information (i.e., access control decisions) ensures that
            such information cannot be altered, spoofed, or otherwise compromised
            during transmission.</p>

          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
          policy and procedures.</p>

          information security programs. Role-based security training also applies

            that can be employed as part of a defense-in-depth strategy to protect
            organizations against malicious code coming in to organizations via email
            or the web applications. Personnel are trained to look for indications
            of potentially suspicious email (e.g., receiving an unexpected email,
            receiving an email containing strange or poor grammar, or receiving an
            email from an unfamiliar sender but who appears to be from a known sponsor
            or contractor). Personnel are also trained on how to respond to such suspicious
            email or web communications (e.g., not opening attachments, not clicking
            on embedded web links, and checking the source of email addresses). For
            this process to work effectively, all organizational personnel are trained
            and made aware of what constitutes suspicious communications. Training
            personnel on how to recognize anomalous behaviors in organizational information
            systems can potentially provide early warning for the presence of malicious
            code. Recognition of such anomalous behavior by organizational personnel
            can supplement automated malicious code detection and protection tools
            and systems employed by organizations.</p>

          the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
          in the AU family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws,
          Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.
          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
          policy and procedures.</p>

      - prose:
        - <p>An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational information
          system. Organizations identify audit events as those events which are significant
          and relevant to the security of information systems and the environments
          in which those systems operate in order to meet specific and ongoing audit
          needs. Audit events can include, for example, password changes, failed logons,
          or failed accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege
          usage, PIV credential usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining
          the set of auditable events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate
          for each of the security controls to be implemented. To balance auditing
          requirements with other information system needs, this control also requires
          identifying that subset of auditable events that are audited at a given
          point in time. For example, organizations may determine that information
          systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful
          and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances
          due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements,
          including the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security
          controls and control enhancements. Organizations also include auditable
          events that are required by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
          policies, regulations, and standards. Audit records can be generated at
          various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information
          traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is
          a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the identification
          of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition of
          auditable events, the auditing necessary to cover related events such as
          the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that
          are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in
          service-oriented architectures.</p>

          mobile device connection, configuration settings, system component inventory,
          use of maintenance tools and nonlocal maintenance, physical access, temperature
          and humidity, equipment delivery and removal, communications at the information
          system boundaries, use of mobile code, and use of VoIP. Findings can be
          reported to organizational entities that include, for example, incident
          response team, help desk, information security group/department. If organizations
          are prohibited from reviewing and analyzing audit information or unable
          to conduct such activities (e.g., in certain national security applications
          or systems), the review/analysis may be carried out by other organizations
          granted such authority.</p>

            generation of performance data, or information system monitoring. Rather,
            the enhancement requires that the analysis of information being otherwise
            produced in these areas is integrated with the analysis of audit information.
            Security Event and Information Management System tools can facilitate
            audit record aggregation/consolidation from multiple information system
            components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of
            standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by organizations
            (with localized script adjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective
            approaches for analyzing audit record information collected. The correlation
            of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information is
            important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans and correlating
            attack detection events with scanning results. Correlation with performance
            data can help uncover denial of service attacks or cyber attacks resulting
            in unauthorized use of resources. Correlation with system monitoring information
            can assist in uncovering attacks and in better relating audit information
            to operational situations.</p>

            documenting organizational policy violations (e.g., sexual harassment

            can lead organizations to a more directed analytical effort to detect
            potential malicious insider activity. Due to the sensitive nature of the
            information available from nontechnical sources, organizations limit access

          Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern

          from UTC. Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization
          between information system clocks and reference clocks, for example, clocks
          synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within tens of milliseconds.
          Organizations may define different time granularities for different system

          - <p>Chain of custody is a process that tracks the movement of evidence
            through its collection, safeguarding, and analysis life cycle by documenting
            each person who handled the evidence, the date and time it was collected
            or transferred, and the purpose for the transfer. If the reviewer is a
            human or if the review function is automated but separate from the release/transfer
            function, the information system associates the identity of the reviewer
            of the information to be released with the information and the information
            label. In the case of human reviews, this control enhancement provides
            organizational officials the means to identify who reviewed and released
            the information. In the case of automated reviews, this control enhancement
            ensures that only approved review functions are employed.</p>

      - prose:
        - <p>When organizations use information systems and/or services of external
          organizations, the auditing capability necessitates a coordinated approach
          across organizations. For example, maintaining the identity of individuals
          that requested particular services across organizational boundaries may
          often be very difficult, and doing so may prove to have significant performance
          ramifications. Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational
          auditing (e.g., the type of auditing capability provided by service-oriented
          architectures) simply captures the identity of individuals issuing requests
          at the initial information system, and subsequent systems record that the
          requests emanated from authorized individuals.</p>

      - prose:
        - '<p>Organizations assess security controls in organizational information
          systems and the environments in which those systems operate as part of:
          (i) initial and ongoing security authorizations; (ii) FISMA annual assessments;
          (iii) continuous monitoring; and (iv) system development life cycle activities.
          Security assessments: (i) ensure that information security is built into
          organizational information systems; (ii) identify weaknesses and deficiencies
          early in the development process; (iii) provide essential information needed
          to make risk-based decisions as part of security authorization processes;
          and (iv) ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Assessments
          are conducted on the implemented security controls from Appendix F (main
          catalog) and Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented in System
          Security Plans and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can
          use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning
          and system monitoring to maintain the security posture of information systems
          during the entire life cycle. Security assessment reports document assessment
          results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine
          the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the security controls
          are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
          outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement
          for assessing security controls at least annually does not require additional
          assessment activities to those activities already in place in organizational
          security authorization processes. Security assessment results are provided
          to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being
          conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of security authorization
          decisions are provided to authorizing officials or authorizing official
          designated representatives. To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations
          can use assessment results from the following sources: (i) initial or ongoing
          information system authorizations; (ii) continuous monitoring; or (iii)   system
          development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security assessment
          results are current, relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness,
          and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing
          security control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the
          results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments
          as needed. Subsequent to initial authorizations and in accordance with OMB
          policy, organizations assess security controls during continuous monitoring.
          Organizations establish the frequency for ongoing security control assessments
          in accordance with organizational continuous monitoring strategies. Information
          Assurance Vulnerability Alerts provide useful examples of vulnerability
          mitigation procedures. External audits (e.g., audits by external entities
          such as regulatory agencies) are outside the scope of this control.</p>'

        - prose:
          - '<p>Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups
            who conduct impartial assessments of organizational information systems.
            Impartiality implies that assessors are free from any perceived or actual
            conflicts of interest with regard to the development, operation, or management
            of the organizational information systems under assessment or to the determination
            of security control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors
            should not: (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations
            where the assessments are being conducted; (ii) assess their own work;
            (iii) act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving;
            or (iv) place themselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations
            acquiring their services. Independent assessments can be obtained from
            elements within organizations or can be contracted to public or private
            sector entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine
            the required level of independence based on the security categories of
            information systems and/or the ultimate risk to organizational operations,
            organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also determine
            if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that
            the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions.
            This includes determining whether contracted security assessment services
            have sufficient independence, for example, when information system owners
            are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot unduly influence
            the impartiality of assessors conducting assessments. In special situations,
            for example, when organizations that own the information systems are small
            or organizational structures require that assessments are conducted by
            individuals that are in the developmental, operational, or management
            chain of system owners, independence in assessment processes can be achieved
            by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed
            by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy,
            integrity, and reliability of the results. Organizations recognize that
            assessments performed for purposes other than direct support to authorization
            decisions are, when performed by assessors with sufficient independence,
            more likely to be useable for such decisions, thereby reducing the need
            to repeat assessments.</p>'

        - <p>This control applies to dedicated connections between information systems
          (i.e., system interconnections) and does not apply to transitory, user-controlled
          connections such as email and website browsing. Organizations carefully
          consider the risks that may be introduced when information systems are connected
          to other systems with different security requirements and security controls,
          both within organizations and external to organizations. Authorizing officials
          determine the risk associated with information system connections and the
          appropriate controls employed. If interconnecting systems have the same
          authorizing official, organizations do not need to develop Interconnection
          Security Agreements. Instead, organizations can describe the interface characteristics
          between those interconnecting systems in their respective security plans.
          If interconnecting systems have different authorizing officials within the
          same organization, organizations can either develop Interconnection Security
          Agreements or describe the interface characteristics between systems in
          the security plans for the respective systems. Organizations may also incorporate
          Interconnection Security Agreement information into formal contracts, especially
          for interconnections established between federal agencies and nonfederal
          (i.e., private sector) organizations. Risk considerations also include information
          systems sharing the same networks. For certain technologies (e.g., space,
          unmanned aerial vehicles, and medical devices), there may be specialized
          connections in place during preoperational testing. Such connections may
          require Interconnection Security Agreements and be subject to additional
          security controls.</p>

        - <p>Security authorizations are official management decisions, conveyed through
          authorization decision documents, by senior organizational officials or
          executives (i.e., authorizing officials) to authorize operation of information
          systems and to explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and
          assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation
          of agreed-upon security controls. Authorizing officials provide budgetary
          oversight for organizational information systems or assume responsibility
          for the mission/business operations supported by those systems. The security
          authorization process is an inherently federal responsibility and therefore,
          authorizing officials must be federal employees. Through the security authorization
          process, authorizing officials assume responsibility and are accountable
          for security risks associated with the operation and use of organizational
          information systems. Accordingly, authorizing officials are in positions
          with levels of authority commensurate with understanding and accepting such
          information security-related risks. OMB policy requires that organizations
          conduct ongoing authorizations of information systems by implementing continuous
          monitoring programs. Continuous monitoring programs can satisfy three-year
          reauthorization requirements, so separate reauthorization processes are
          not necessary. Through the employment of comprehensive continuous monitoring
          processes, critical information contained in authorization packages (i.e.,
          security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones)
          is updated on an ongoing basis, providing authorizing officials and information
          system owners with an up-to-date status of the security state of organizational
          information systems and environments of operation.  To reduce the administrative
          cost of security reauthorization, authorizing officials use the results
          of continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the
          basis for rendering reauthorization decisions.</p>

        - <p>Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats,
          vulnerabilities, and information security to support organizational risk
          management decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations
          assess/analyze security controls and information security-related risks
          at a frequency sufficient to support organizational risk-based decisions.
          The results of continuous monitoring programs generate appropriate risk
          response actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring programs also allow
          organizations to maintain the security authorizations of information systems
          and common controls over time in highly dynamic environments of operation
          with changing mission/business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies.
          Having access to security-related information on a continuing basis through
          reports/dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make
          more effective and timely risk management decisions, including ongoing security
          authorization decisions. Automation supports more frequent updates to security
          authorization packages, hardware/software/firmware inventories, and other
          system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring
          outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable,
          actionable, relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled
          in accordance with the security categories of information systems.</p>

        - '<p>Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on
          information systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities
          that could be exploited by adversaries. Such testing can be used to either
          validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of resistance organizational
          information systems have to adversaries within a set of specified constraints
          (e.g., time, resources, and/or skills). Penetration testing attempts to
          duplicate the actions of adversaries in carrying out hostile cyber attacks
          against organizations and provides a more in-depth analysis of security-related
          weaknesses/deficiencies. Organizations can also use the results of vulnerability
          analyses to support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing
          can be conducted on the hardware, software, or firmware components of an
          information system and can exercise both physical and technical security
          controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes, for example:
          (i) pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the target system; (ii)
          pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis;
          and (iii) testing designed to determine exploitability of identified vulnerabilities.
          All parties agree to the rules of engagement before the commencement of
          penetration testing scenarios. Organizations correlate the penetration testing
          rules of engagement with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are
          anticipated to be employed by adversaries carrying out attacks. Organizational
          risk assessments guide decisions on the level of independence required for
          personnel conducting penetration testing.</p>'

          - <p>Red team exercises extend the objectives of penetration testing by
            examining the security posture of organizations and their ability to implement
            effective cyber defenses. As such, red team exercises reflect simulated
            adversarial attempts to compromise organizational mission/business functions
            and provide a comprehensive assessment of the security state of information
            systems and organizations. Simulated adversarial attempts to compromise
            organizational missions/business functions and the information systems
            that support those missions/functions may include technology-focused attacks
            (e.g., interactions with hardware, software, or firmware components and/or
            mission/business processes) and social engineering-based attacks (e.g.,
            interactions via email, telephone, shoulder surfing, or personal conversations).
            While penetration testing may be largely laboratory-based testing, organizations
            use red team exercises to provide more comprehensive assessments that
            reflect real-world conditions. Red team exercises can be used to improve
            security awareness and training and to assess levels of security control
            effectiveness.</p>

          the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
          in the CM family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws,
          Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.
          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
          policy and procedures.</p>

        - <p>This control establishes baseline configurations for information systems
          and system components including communications and connectivity-related
          aspects of systems. Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed
          and agreed-upon sets of specifications for information systems or configuration
          items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for
          future builds, releases, and/or changes to information systems. Baseline
          configurations include information about information system components (e.g.,
          standard software packages installed on workstations, notebook computers,
          servers, network components, or mobile devices; current version numbers
          and patch information on operating systems and applications; and configuration
          settings/parameters), network topology, and the logical placement of those
          components within the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations
          requires creating new baselines as organizational information systems change
          over time. Baseline configurations of information systems reflect the current
          enterprise architecture.</p>

          involve the systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing,
          review, and disposition of changes to the systems, including system upgrades
          and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to baseline
          configurations for components and configuration items of information systems,
          changes to configuration settings for information technology products (e.g.,
          operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers, and mobile devices),
          unscheduled/unauthorized changes, and changes to remediate vulnerabilities.
          Typical processes for managing configuration changes to information systems
          include, for example, Configuration Control Boards that approve proposed
          changes to systems. For new development information systems or systems undergoing
          major upgrades, organizations consider including representatives from development
          organizations on the Configuration Control Boards. Auditing of changes includes
          activities before and after changes are made to organizational information
          systems and the auditing activities required to implement such changes.</p>

          conduct security impact analyses. Individuals conducting security impact
          analyses possess the necessary skills/technical expertise to analyze the
          changes to information systems and the associated security ramifications.
          Security impact analysis may include, for example, reviewing security plans
          to understand security control requirements and reviewing system design
          documentation to understand control implementation and how specific changes
          might affect the controls. Security impact analyses may also include assessments
          of risk to better understand the impact of the changes and to determine
          if additional security controls are required. Security impact analyses are
          scaled in accordance with the security categories of the information systems.</p>

            functions. Limiting privileges to change information system components
            with respect to operational systems is necessary because changes to a
            particular information system component may have far-reaching effects
            on mission/business processes supported by the system where the component
            resides. The complex, many-to-many relationships between systems and mission/business
            processes are in some cases, unknown to developers.</p>

          and authorized individuals to access information systems for purposes of

          maintain records of access to ensure that configuration change control is
          implemented and to support after-the-fact actions should organizations discover
          any unauthorized changes. Access restrictions for change also include software
          libraries. Access restrictions include, for example, physical and logical
          access controls (see AC-3 and PE-3), workflow automation, media libraries,
          abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into third-party interfaces rather
          than directly into information systems), and change windows (e.g., changes
          occur only during specified times, making unauthorized changes easy to discover).</p>

        - '<p>Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed
          in hardware, software, or firmware components of the information system
          that affect the security posture and/or functionality of the system. Information
          technology products for which security-related configuration settings can
          be defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers (e.g., database,
          electronic mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), workstations,
          input/output devices (e.g.,  scanners, copiers, and printers), network components
          (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access
          points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware, and
          applications. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting
          the security state of information systems including the parameters required
          to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters
          include, for example: (i) registry settings; (ii) account, file, directory
          permission settings; and (iii) settings for functions, ports, protocols,
          services, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide
          configuration settings and subsequently derive specific settings for information
          systems. The established settings become part of the systems configuration
          baseline. Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration
          checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, security reference guides, security
          technical implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established
          benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for specific information
          technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those information
          system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations
          can be developed by a variety of organizations including, for example, information
          technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia,
          industry, federal agencies, and other organizations in the public and private
          sectors. Common secure configurations include the United States Government
          Configuration Baseline (USGCB) which affects the implementation of CM-6
          and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content Automation
          Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol (e.g., Common
          Configuration Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely identify,
          track, and control configuration settings. OMB establishes federal policy
          on configuration requirements for federal information systems.</p>'

        - <p>Information systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services.
          Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary
          to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).
          Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from
          single information system components, but doing so increases risk over limiting
          the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations
          limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email
          servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations review functions and
          services provided by information systems or individual components of information
          systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination
          (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and
          file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical
          and logical ports/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol,
          and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information systems to prevent unauthorized
          connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized
          tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection
          and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and
          host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of
          prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services.</p>

            within information systems or in other separate devices. Isolation can

            This type of component isolation is commonly referred to as sandboxing.</p>

        - <p>Configuration management plans satisfy the requirements in configuration
          management policies while being tailored to individual information systems.
          Such plans define detailed processes and procedures for how configuration
          management is used to support system development life cycle activities at
          the information system level. Configuration management plans are typically
          developed during the development/acquisition phase of the system development
          life cycle. The plans describe how to move changes through change management
          processes, how to update configuration settings and baselines, how to maintain
          information system component inventories, how to control development, test,
          and operational environments, and how to develop, release, and update key
          documents. Organizations can employ templates to help ensure consistent
          and timely development and implementation of configuration management plans.
          Such templates can represent a master configuration management plan for
          the organization at large with subsets of the plan implemented on a system
          by system basis. Configuration management approval processes include designation
          of key management stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving proposed
          changes to information systems, and personnel that conduct security impact
          analyses prior to the implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration
          items are the information system items (hardware, software, firmware, and
          documentation) to be configuration-managed. As information systems continue
          through the system development life cycle, new configuration items may be
          identified and some existing configuration items may no longer need to be
          under configuration control.</p>

        - <p>This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for
          the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
          in the CP family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws,
          Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.
          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
          policy and procedures.</p>

        - <p>Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall organizational
          program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business functions.
          Contingency planning addresses both information system restoration and implementation
          of alternative mission/business processes when systems are compromised.
          The effectiveness of contingency planning is maximized by considering such
          planning throughout the phases of the system development life cycle. Performing
          contingency planning on hardware, software, and firmware development can
          be an effective means of achieving information system resiliency. Contingency
          plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational information
          systems since not all systems may need to fully recover to achieve the level
          of continuity of operations desired.  Information system recovery objectives
          reflect applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards,
          regulations, and guidelines. In addition to information system availability,
          contingency plans also address other security-related events resulting in
          a reduction in mission and/or business effectiveness, such as malicious
          attacks compromising the confidentiality or integrity of information systems.
          Actions addressed in contingency plans include, for example, orderly/graceful
          degradation, information system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate
          information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are
          under attack. By closely coordinating contingency planning with incident
          handling activities, organizations can ensure that the necessary contingency
          planning activities are in place and activated in the event of a security
          incident.</p>

            planning including, for example, as part of business impact analyses.
            Organizations identify critical information system assets so that additional
            safeguards and countermeasures can be employed (above and beyond those
            safeguards and countermeasures routinely implemented) to help ensure that
            organizational missions/business functions can continue to be conducted
            during contingency operations. In addition, the identification of critical
            information assets facilitates the prioritization of organizational resources.
            Critical information system assets include technical and operational aspects.
            Technical aspects include, for example, information technology services,
            information system components, information technology products, and mechanisms.
            Operational aspects include, for example, procedures (manually executed
            operations) and personnel (individuals operating technical safeguards
            and/or executing manual procedures). Organizational program protection
            plans can provide assistance in identifying critical assets.</p>

          place following recovery and includes activities for returning organizational
          information systems to fully operational states. Recovery and reconstitution
          operations reflect mission and business priorities, recovery point/time
          and reconstitution objectives, and established organizational metrics consistent
          with contingency plan requirements. Reconstitution includes the deactivation
          of any interim information system capabilities that may have been needed
          during recovery operations. Reconstitution also includes assessments of
          fully restored information system capabilities, reestablishment of continuous
          monitoring activities, potential information system reauthorizations, and
          activities to prepare the systems against future disruptions, compromises,
          or failures. Recovery/reconstitution capabilities employed by organizations

          in the IA family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws,
          Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.
          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
          policy and procedures.</p>

          users (or processes acting on behalf of organizational users).</p>

        class: statement
      - prose:
        - '<p>Organizational users include employees or individuals that organizations
          deem to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors, guest researchers).
          This control applies to all accesses other than: (i) accesses that are explicitly
          identified and documented in AC-14; and (ii) accesses that occur through
          authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication.
          Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group
          accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability
          of individual activity. Organizations employ passwords, tokens, or biometrics
          to authenticate user identities, or in the case multifactor authentication,
          or some combination thereof. Access to organizational information systems
          is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any
          access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting
          on behalf of users) where such access is obtained by direct connections
          without the use of networks. Network access is access to organizational
          information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where
          such access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses).
          Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through
          external networks (e.g., the Internet). Internal networks include local
          area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of encrypted
          virtual private networks (VPNs) for network connections between organization-controlled
          endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal
          networks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality and integrity
          of information traversing the network. Organizations can satisfy the identification
          and authentication requirements in this control by complying with the requirements
          in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with the specific
          organizational implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires
          the use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The
          factors are defined as: (i) something you know (e.g., password, personal
          identification number [PIN]); (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic
          identification device, token); or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric).
          Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information systems
          gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing time-based
          or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government
          Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD common access card. In addition
          to identifying and authenticating users at the information system level
          (i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification and authentication
          mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased
          information security. Identification and authentication requirements for
          other than organizational users are described in IA-8.</p>'

            \ communication paths to identify and authenticate users or devices to\
            \ an information system. The first path (i.e., the in-band path), is used\
            \ to identify and authenticate users or devices, and generally is the\
            \ path through which information flows. The second path (i.e., the out-of-band\
            \ path) is used to independently verify the authentication and/or requested\
            \ action. For example, a user authenticates via a notebook computer to\
            \ a remote server to which the user desires access, and requests some\
            \ action of the server via that communication path. Subsequently, the\
            \ server contacts the user via the user\u2019s cell phone to verify that\
            \ the requested action originated from the user. The user may either confirm\
            \ the intended action to an individual on the telephone or provide an\
            \ authentication code via the telephone. This type of authentication can\
            \ be employed by organizations to mitigate actual or suspected man-in\
            \ the-middle attacks. The conditions for activation can include, for example,\
            \ suspicious activities, new threat indicators or elevated threat levels,\
            \ or the impact level or classification level of information in requested\

        - <p>Organizational devices requiring unique device-to-device identification

          of type/device. Information systems typically use either shared known information
          (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC] or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
          Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device identification or organizational
          authentication solutions (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication
          Protocol [EAP], Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication,
          Kerberos) to identify/authenticate devices on local and/or wide area networks.
          Organizations determine the required strength of authentication mechanisms
          by the security categories of information systems. Because of the challenges
          of applying this control on large scale, organizations are encouraged to
          only apply the control to those limited number (and type) of devices that
          truly need to support this capability.</p>

        - <p>Common device identifiers include, for example, media access control
          (MAC), Internet protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers.
          Management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared information
          system accounts (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts). Typically, individual
          identifiers are the user names of the information system accounts assigned
          to those individuals. In such instances, the account management activities
          of AC-2 use account names provided by IA-4. This control also addresses
          individual identifiers not necessarily associated with information system
          accounts (e.g., identifiers used in physical security control databases
          accessed by badge reader systems for access to information systems). Preventing
          reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used
          individual, group, role, or device identifiers to different individuals,
          groups, roles, or devices.</p>

        - <p>Individual authenticators include, for example, passwords, tokens, biometrics,
          PKI certificates, and key cards. Initial authenticator content is the actual
          content (e.g., the initial password) as opposed to requirements about authenticator
          content (e.g., minimum password length). In many cases, developers ship
          information system components with factory default authentication credentials
          to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication
          credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant
          security risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may
          be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession
          of individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators
          stored within organizational information systems (e.g., passwords stored
          in hashed or encrypted formats, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords
          accessible with administrator privileges). Information systems support individual
          authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions
          for various authenticator characteristics including, for example, minimum
          password length, password composition, validation time window for time synchronous
          one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification
          stage of biometric authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to
          safeguard authenticators include, for example, maintaining possession of
          individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing individual authenticators
          with others, and reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately.
          Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed,
          authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance.
          Device authenticators include, for example, certificates and passwords.</p>

            individuals using passwords as individual or group authenticators, and
            in a similar manner, when passwords are part of multifactor authenticators.
            This control enhancement does not apply when passwords are used to unlock
            hardware authenticators (e.g., Personal Identity Verification cards).
            The implementation of such password mechanisms may not meet all of the
            requirements in the enhancement. Cryptographically-protected passwords
            include, for example, encrypted versions of passwords and one-way cryptographic
            hashes of passwords. The number of changed characters refers to the number
            of changes required with respect to the total number of positions in the
            current password. Password lifetime restrictions do not apply to temporary
            passwords. To mitigate certain brute force attacks against passwords,
            organizations may also consider salting passwords.</p>

            this binding is established by pre-provisioning both the identity and
            the authenticator to the information system. For example, the binding
            between a username (i.e., identity) and a password (i.e., authenticator)
            is accomplished by provisioning the identity and authenticator as a pair
            in the information system. New authentication techniques allow the binding
            between the identity and the authenticator to be implemented outside an
            information system. For example, with smartcard credentials, the identity
            and the authenticator are bound together on the card. Using these credentials,
            information systems can authenticate identities that have not been pre-provisioned,
            dynamically provisioning the identity after authentication. In these situations,
            organizations can anticipate the dynamic provisioning of identities. Preestablished
            trust relationships and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate
            identities and related credentials are essential.</p>

            not provide such exact matches. Depending upon the type of biometric and
            the type of collection mechanism, there is likely to be some divergence
            from the presented biometric and stored biometric which serves as the
            basis of comparison. There will likely be both false positives and false
            negatives when making such comparisons. The rate at which the false accept
            and false reject rates are equal is known as the crossover rate. Biometric

        - <p>The feedback from information systems does not provide information that

          For some types of information systems or system components, for example,
          desktops/notebooks with relatively large monitors, the threat (often referred
          to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of systems or
          components, for example, mobile devices with 2-4 inch screens, this threat
          may be less significant, and may need to be balanced against the increased
          likelihood of typographic input errors due to the small keyboards. Therefore,
          the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback is selected accordingly.
          Obscuring the feedback of authentication information includes, for example,
          displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices, or displaying
          feedback for a very limited time before fully obscuring it.</p>

          E-Government initiative, authentication of non-organizational users accessing

          or privacy-related information (with exceptions noted for national security

          occur with any authentication mechanisms employed by organizations. To address
          this threat, organizations may employ specific techniques/mechanisms and
          establish protocols to assess suspicious behavior (e.g., individuals accessing
          information that they do not typically access as part of their normal duties,
          roles, or responsibilities, accessing greater quantities of information
          than the individuals would routinely access, or attempting to access information
          from suspicious network addresses). In these situations when certain preestablished
          conditions or triggers occur, organizations can require selected individuals
          to provide additional authentication information. Another potential use
          for adaptive identification and authentication is to increase the strength
          of mechanism based on the number and/or types of records being accessed.</p>

          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations

          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing

        - <p>Organizations recognize that incident response capability is dependent
          on the capabilities of organizational information systems and the mission/business
          processes being supported by those systems. Therefore, organizations consider
          incident response as part of the definition, design, and development of
          mission/business processes and information systems. Incident-related information
          can be obtained from a variety of sources including, for example, audit
          monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user/administrator
          reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling capability
          includes coordination among many organizational entities including, for
          example, mission/business owners, information system owners, authorizing
          officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices,
          legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk
          executive (function).</p>

            reconfiguration of information systems, for example, to stop attacks,
            to misdirect attackers, and to isolate components of systems, thus limiting
            the extent of the damage from breaches or compromises. Organizations include
            time frames for achieving the reconfiguration of information systems in
            the definition of the reconfiguration capability, considering the potential
            need for rapid response in order to effectively address sophisticated

        - <p>The intent of this control is to address both specific incident reporting
          requirements within an organization and the formal incident reporting requirements
          for federal agencies and their subordinate organizations. Suspected security
          incidents include, for example, the receipt of suspicious email communications
          that can potentially contain malicious code. The types of security incidents
          reported, the content and timeliness of the reports, and the designated
          reporting authorities reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
          directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Current federal
          policy requires that all federal agencies (unless specifically exempted
          from such requirements) report security incidents to the United States Computer
          Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) within specified time frames designated
          in the US-CERT Concept of Operations for Federal Cyber Security Incident
          Handling.</p>

        - <p>Information spillage refers to instances where either classified or sensitive
          information is inadvertently placed on information systems that are not
          authorized to process such information. Such information spills often occur
          when information that is initially thought to be of lower sensitivity is
          transmitted to an information system and then is subsequently determined
          to be of higher sensitivity. At that point, corrective action is required.
          The nature of the organizational response is generally based upon the degree
          of sensitivity of the spilled information (e.g., security category or classification
          level), the security capabilities of the information system, the specific
          nature of contaminated storage media, and the access authorizations (e.g.,
          security clearances) of individuals with authorized access to the contaminated
          system. The methods used to communicate information about the spill after
          the fact do not involve methods directly associated with the actual spill
          to minimize the risk of further spreading the contamination before such
          contamination is isolated and eradicated.</p>

        - <p>Having an integrated team for incident response facilitates information
          sharing. Such capability allows organizational personnel, including developers,
          implementers, and operators, to leverage the team knowledge of the threat
          in order to implement defensive measures that will enable organizations
          to deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, it promotes the rapid detection
          of intrusions, development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment
          of effective defensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected,
          the integrated security analysis team can rapidly develop an appropriate
          response for operators to implement, correlate the new incident with information
          on past intrusions, and augment ongoing intelligence development. This enables
          the team to identify adversary TTPs that are linked to the operations tempo
          or to specific missions/business functions, and to define responsive actions
          in a way that does not disrupt the mission/business operations. Ideally,
          information security analysis teams are distributed within organizations
          to make the capability more resilient.</p>

          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations

          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
          policy and procedures.</p>

          if necessary; (iv) a description of the maintenance performed; and (v) information
          system components/equipment removed or replaced (including identification
          numbers, if applicable). The level of detail included in maintenance records

        - <p>Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted
          by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network
          (e.g., the Internet) or an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic
          activities are those activities carried out by individuals physically present
          at the information system or information system component and not communicating
          across a network connection. Authentication techniques used in the establishment
          of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access
          requirements in IA-2. Typically, strong authentication requires authenticators
          that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multifactor authentication.
          Strong authenticators include, for example, PKI where certificates are stored
          on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or biometric. Enforcing
          requirements in MA-4 is accomplished in part by other controls.</p>

          Individuals not previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel,
          such as information technology manufacturers, vendors, systems integrators,
          and consultants, may require privileged access to organizational information
          systems, for example, when required to conduct maintenance activities with
          little or no notice. Based on organizational assessments of risk, organizations
          may issue temporary credentials to these individuals. Temporary credentials

          - <p>Predictive maintenance, or condition-based maintenance, attempts to
            evaluate the condition of equipment by performing periodic or continuous
            (online) equipment condition monitoring. The goal of predictive maintenance
            is to perform maintenance at a scheduled point in time when the maintenance
            activity is most cost-effective and before the equipment loses performance
            within a threshold. The predictive component of predictive maintenance
            stems from the goal of predicting the future trend of the equipment's
            condition. This approach uses principles of statistical process control
            to determine at what point in the future maintenance activities will be
            appropriate. Most predictive maintenance inspections are performed while
            equipment is in service, thereby minimizing disruption of normal system
            operations. Predictive maintenance can result in substantial cost savings
            and higher system reliability. Predictive maintenance tends to include
            measurement of the item. To evaluate equipment condition, predictive maintenance
            utilizes nondestructive testing technologies such as infrared, acoustic
            (partial discharge and airborne ultrasonic), corona detection, vibration
            analysis, sound level measurements, oil analysis, and other specific online
            tests.</p>

          the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
          in the MP family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws,
          Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.
          Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make
          the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy
          can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
          or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
          nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
          security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.
          The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
          policy and procedures.</p>

        - <p>The term security marking refers to the application/use of human-readable
          security attributes. The term security labeling refers to the application/use
          of security attributes with regard to internal data structures within information
          systems (see AC-16). Information system media includes both digital and
          non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic
          tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks,
          and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper
          and microfilm. Security marking is generally not required for media containing
          information determined by organizations to be in the public domain or to
          be publicly releasable. However, some organizations may require markings
          for public information indicating that the information is publicly releasable.
          Marking of information system media reflects applicable federal laws, Executive
          Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.</p>

          hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks.
          Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. Physically
          controlling information system media includes, for example, conducting inventories,
          ensuring procedures are in place to allow individuals to check out and return
          media to the media library, and maintaining accountability for all stored
          media. Secure storage includes, for example, a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet,
          or a controlled media library. The type of media storage is commensurate
          with the security category and/or classification of the information residing
          on the media. Controlled areas are areas for which organizations provide
          sufficient physical and procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established
          for protecting information and/or information systems. For media containing
          information determined by organizations to be in the public domain, to be
          publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact on organizations
          or individuals if accessed by other than authorized personnel, fewer safeguards
          may be needed. In these situations, physical access controls provide adequate
          protection.</p>

        - <p>Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media.
          Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable
          hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks.
          Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. This control
          also applies to mobile devices with information storage capability (e.g.,
          smart phones, tablets, E-readers), that are transported outside of controlled
          areas. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide
          sufficient physical and/or procedural safeguards to meet the requirements
          established for protecting information and/or information systems. Physical
          and technical safeguards for media are commensurate with the security category
          or classification of the information residing on the media. Safeguards to
          protect media during transport include, for example, locked containers and
          cryptography. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity
          protections depending upon the mechanisms used. Activities associated with
          transport include the actual transport as well as those activities such
          as releasing media for transport and ensuring that media enters the appropriate
          transport processes. For the actual transport, authorized transport and
          courier personnel may include individuals from outside the organization
          (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial transport or delivery service).
          Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes, for example,
          restricting transport activities to authorized personnel, and tracking and/or
          obtaining explicit records of transport activities as the media moves through
          the transportation system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering.
          Organizations establish documentation requirements for activities associated
          with the transport of information system media in accordance with organizational
          assessments of risk to include the flexibility to define different record-keeping
          methods for the different types of media transport as part of an overall
          system of transport-related records.</p>

          information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques,
          including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent
          the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media
          is reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate
          sanitization methods recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary
          when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations
          use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and
          procedures for media containing information deemed to be in the public domain
          or publicly releasable, or deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations
          or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital
          media includes, for example, removing a classified appendix from an otherwise
          unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document
          by obscuring the redacted sections/words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness
          to removing them from the document. NSA standards and policies control the
          sanitization process for media containing classified information.</p>

        - <p>Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media.
          Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable
          hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks.
          Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. This control
          also applies to mobile devices with information storage capability (e.g.,
          smart phones, tablets, E-readers). In contrast to MP-2, which restricts
          user access to media, this control restricts the use of certain types of
          media on information systems, for example, restricting/prohibiting the use
          of flash drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations can employ technical
          and nontechnical safeguards (e.g., policies, procedures, rules of behavior)
          to restrict the use of information system media. Organizations may restrict
          the use of portable storage devices, for example, by using physical cages
          on workstations to prohibit access to certain external ports, or disabling/removing
          the ability to insert, read or write to such devices. Organizations may
          also limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices
          including, for example, devices provided by the organization, devices provided
          by other approved organizations, and devices that are not personally owned.
          Finally, organizations may restrict the use of portable storage devices
          based on the type of device, for example, prohibiting the use of writeable,
          portable storage devices, and implementing this restriction by disabling
          or removing the capability to write to such devices.</p>
